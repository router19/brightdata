## üåü Overview

Welcome to the official Bright Data Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling LLMs, agents and apps to access, discover and extract web data in real-time. This server allows MCP clients, such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf and others, to seamlessly search the web, navigate websites, take action and retrieve data - without getting blocked - perfect for scraping tasks.

## üöÄ Quickstart with Claude Desktop
### Through [Claude Desktop Extension](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10949351-getting-started-with-model-context-protocol-mcp-on-claude-for-desktop#h_4819d0d1b4):

1. **Download** the Claude Desktop Extension:  
   [üì¶ Bright Data's MCP Extension](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp/raw/refs/heads/main/brightdata-mcp-extension.dxt)

2. **Open** Claude and go to:  
   `Settings` ‚Üí `Extensions`

3. **Drag** the `.dtx` file from **Step 1** into the **dropping area**.

4. **Enable** the service and **restart** Claude.
5. Enjoy!

### Through `claude_desktop_config.json`:

1. Install `nodejs` to get the `npx` command (node.js module runner). Installation instructions can be found on the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

2. Go to Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > Edit "claude_desktop_config.json" to include the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bright Data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@brightdata/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "<insert-your-api-token-here>",
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### üõ∏ Or for more advanced options: 

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bright Data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@brightdata/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "<insert-your-api-token-here>",
        "RATE_LIMIT": "<optional if you want to change rate limit format: limit/time+unit, e.g., 100/1h, 50/30m, 10/5s>",
        "WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE": "<optional if you want to override the web unlocker zone name - default is mcp_unlocker>",
        "BROWSER_ZONE": "<optional if you want to override the browser zone name - defaults is mcp_browser>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîß Available Tools

[List of Available Tools](https://github.com/brightdata-com/brightdata-mcp/blob/main/assets/Tools.md)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

**Important:** Always treat scraped web content as untrusted data. Never use raw scraped content directly in LLM prompts to avoid potential prompt injection risks. 
Instead:
- Filter and validate all web data before processing
- Use structured data extraction rather than raw text (web_data tools)

## üîß Account Setup

1. Make sure you have an account on [brightdata.com](https://brightdata.com) (new users get free credit for testing, and pay as you go options are available)

2. Get your API key from the [user settings page](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users), or from the welcome email you received

####   Optional:

3. Configure rate limiting:
   - Set the `RATE_LIMIT` environment variable to control API usage
   - Format: `limit/time+unit` (e.g., `100/1h` for 100 calls per hour)
   - Supported time units: seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h)
   - Examples: `RATE_LIMIT=100/1h`, `RATE_LIMIT=50/30m`, `RATE_LIMIT=10/5s`
   - Rate limiting is session-based (resets when server restarts)

4. Create a custom Web Unlocker zone 
   - By default, we create a Web Unlocker zone automatically using your API token
   - For more control, you can create your own Web Unlocker zone in your [control panel](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones) and specify it with the `WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE` environment variable

5. Create a custom  Browser API zone:
   - By default, we create a Browser API zone automatically using your API token.
   - For more control, you can create your own Browser API zone in your [control panel](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones) and specify it with the `BROWSER_ZONE` environment variable

## üîå Other MCP Clients

To use this MCP server with other agent types, you should adapt the following to your specific software:

- Before running the server, make sure the `API_TOKEN=<your-token>` environment variable is set
- The full command to run the MCP server is `npx @brightdata/mcp`


#### üíª macOS / Linux (bash/zsh)

```bash
export API_TOKEN=your-token
npx @brightdata/mcp
```

#### ü™ü Windows (Command Prompt)

```cmd
set API_TOKEN=your-token
npx @brightdata/mcp
```

#### ü™ü Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:API_TOKEN="your-token"
npx @brightdata/mcp
```

> üí° **Tip:** You can also use a `.env` file and a tool like [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to manage environment variables more easily during development.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Timeouts when using certain tools

Some tools can involve reading web data, and the amount of time needed to load the page can vary by quite a lot in extreme circumstances.

To ensure that your agent will be able to consume the data, set a high enough timeout in your agent settings.

A value of `180s` should be enough for 99% of requests, but some sites load slower than others, so tune this to your needs.

### spawn npx ENOENT

This error occurs when your system cannot find the `npx` command. To fix it:

#### Finding npm/Node Path

**macOS:**

```
which node
```

Shows path like `/usr/local/bin/node`

**Windows:**

```
where node
```

Shows path like `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`

#### Update your MCP configuration:

Replace the `npx` command with the full path to Node, for example, on mac, it will look as follows:

```
"command": "/usr/local/bin/node"
```
